# Introduction to Kubernetes Claude MCP

The Kubernetes Claude MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integrates Claude's AI capabilities with Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and GitLab to provide AI-powered analysis and troubleshooting for your GitOps workflows.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework for providing structured context to large language models like Claude. It enables these models to understand complex systems by providing them with relevant information in a format they can process effectively.

In the context of Kubernetes:

- **Context Collection**: MCP gathers critical information from Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and GitLab
- **Correlation**: It connects information across systems to provide a complete picture
- **Intelligence**: Claude AI processes this context to provide actionable insights

## Key Features

- **Resource Analysis**: Get AI-powered analysis of Kubernetes resources
- **GitOps Integration**: Connect your resources to their source code and deployment pipelines
- **Troubleshooting**: Automatically identify and resolve issues in your cluster
- **RESTful API**: Integrate with your existing tools and workflows
