# Introduction to Kubernetes Claude MCP

The Kubernetes Claude MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integrates Claude's AI capabilities with Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and GitLab to provide AI-powered analysis and troubleshooting for your GitOps workflows.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework for providing structured context to large language models like Claude. It enables these models to understand complex systems by providing them with relevant information in a format they can process effectively.

In the context of Kubernetes:

- **Context Collection**: MCP gathers critical information from Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and GitLab
- **Correlation**: It connects information across systems to provide a complete picture
- **Intelligence**: Claude AI processes this context to provide actionable insights
